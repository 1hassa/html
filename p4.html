When it comes to understanding database systems, there may be better no better person to speak with than Dr. Michael Stonebraker, who, along with Eugene Wong in 1974, created the first working relational database system, INGRES. Even more remarkable,
 he has kept pace with the database system development in the 40 years since.
At the University of California at Berkeley, 
he soon went on to expand on the work on INGRES for an object-relational database management system, Postgres. Later, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
 he co-architected the Aurora/Borealis stream processing engine, the C-Store column-oriented DBMS,
  the H-Store transaction processing engine, which became VoltDB, the SciDB array database management system, and the Data Tamer data curation system. 
Presently he serves as an advisor to VoltDB and chief technology officer of Paradigm4 and Tamr.
