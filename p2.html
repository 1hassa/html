    <td>Hierarchical Database System Structure was developed by IBM in the early 1960s.
      In this type of Database,data gets stored in parent-children relationship nodes.
       Also, the records not only contain the data of it but of their parent and children as well.
      As the name suggests, ‘Hierarchy’, it is a tree-like structure.
       There are links attached between each record as a parent-children relationship.
      Data gets stored in the form of a collection of fields in which each field contains only one value, i.e., every individual record has only one parent and a parent can have one or more than one children.
      To retrieve the data, we need to traverse each tree until we get the desired data.</td>
    <td>The network database structure was invented by Charles Bachman. 
      Network database management systems (Network DBMSs) uses network structure to create a relationship between entities.
      Network databases are mainly used on a large network of computers.
      Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases differs with one key point that in network databases one node can have a relationship with multiple entities.
      In network databases, parents are termed as occupier and children are termed as members. 
      Data in the network database is organized as many-to-many relationships.</td>
    <td>Relational Databases are the most popular among all databases.
In this type of database, there is a relationship between data and that is stored in the form of the table of rows and columns, such that row represents record and column represents the attribute.
Every individual field represents the data value.
 In order to query the Relational Databases, Structured Query Language (SQL) is used which includes insertion, deletion, manipulation and search the records.</td>
